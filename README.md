- Hi, I’m @Draak73
- 
- I’m interested in trying and learning Ssh, Html, Python, Js, and Css via V.s.c. for the hobby. 
- I am 48 years old and also a complete novice in codes other than html ie I can create a main page.

I watch a lot of tutorials on youtube and have downloaded some labs to practice on the tel...,

I once ran a web server on win xp with iis in 2015 and coded with Powerpoint, Coolcast,
so building what now comes in WordPress no code,
I also did the cutting, pasting, embedding and twirling with small pieces of html code.

I hope to learn a lot here and excuse me if I ask a lot.
If I can help with anything I certainly will!!!

The Private Project is a mini website with: 1.Main, 2.login & stream 3.info & Contact page. 
and a mini N>A>S behind it.

And this runs on a Raspberry pi4.B - 8GB
Data carrier's : 
1 Fireball 3-ATA/133-40 pin-hdd 20 GB, 
1 Seagate u6-Model ST340810A-ultra-ata/133-40 PIN-40GB on a hdd to Usb doc.
1 Logilink UAO125 AC Adapter 10 usb slots minus 1 for the hdd/doc.
Router Connectbox from Ziggo.

The only code I have at the moment is:
The login page with html 5, Index.html and css3 style.css and the MIT license coppyricht info at : https://spck.io/labs
I got this via the app SPK Editor.

I hope some one shees the fun in this and help is WELKOM!!!!
